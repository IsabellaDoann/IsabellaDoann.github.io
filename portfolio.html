        <p> The game "Escape" is about a girl who gets trapped in a dungeon full of monsters.
        The point of the game is to go through the doors and survive. The scoring system will
        go up every single time a monster is killed. The monsters that attack the playere will
        attack randomly. The game gets more difficult after you defeat each monster. The user
        loses when their health is depleted.</p>
        <br>
        <p> I made this specific game because I wanted something scary, but it turned out to be
        more like a story-based rpg. However, it still achieves what I was going for. My game was
        inspired by this horror game that used doors and monsters. What I though went well was the 
        characters and the actual gameplay. One obstacle was the attack sprites being inconsistent. 
        In the end, I figured out a way for the sprites to all act the same way, and do what they
        are supposed to do. Another obstacle was deciding how hard the game should be. The game seemed
        to hard sometimes, but at other times, seemed to easy. I finally found the right combination 
        of health and attacks to balance the game. If I more time or resources, I would most definitely
        change the sprites and backgrounds to be more high-quality. Most of all, I would have changed
        the attack patterns and overall gameplay.</p>

        <h2> Algorithm</h2>
        <img src="Capture2.PNG">
        <p> This piece of code is an algorithm because contains different types of blocks, and is a step-by-step procedure. 
        For example, one thing happens and so on. This particular code makes the fox sprite visible when the backdrop
        switches to backdrop 1. This is also prompts the heath bar to show up. The next two combinations make the sprite shake 
        and die if its health is depleted.</p>
