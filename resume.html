        <p>My name is Isabella Doan, and three strengths of mine are determination, 
        being thorough, and I'm a fast worker. However, three weaknesses of mine are communication,
        assertiveness, and laziness. I know Java, and I know how to code. I have knowledge about
        computers themselves, and a little about what's inside. I intend to work with computers, but any 
        job that I enjoy works just as well. I volunteer at libraries and many other places. I have not
        had any previous work experience, but I believe that I am very qualified.</p>
